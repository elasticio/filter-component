# Filter Component [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![circle-url]

## Description

A component to filter the incoming data based on an arbitrary JSONata expression.

## How it works

Filter will pass through the incoming data if it matches the JSONata condition specified
in the configuration. The expression can be any valid __JSONata__ expression, so you can be creative.
Here are some examples that are possible:

*   `true`
*   `false`
*   `$not(false)`
*   `$not(true)`
*    `20 > 5`
*   `body.foo` - will be true if `body.foo` is defined and not `false`

## Requirements

### Environment variables

By default no environment variable is necessary to operate the component.

## Triggers

This component has no trigger functions, so it is not selectable as a trigger (first step in an integration flow).

## Actions

### Simple JSONata Filter

This action has two parameters and a checkbox:

Parameters:
*   `Filter condition` - A __JSONata__ expression passed in through the cfg. The expression will be evaluated to a value of  `true` or `false`. If 
it is evaluated to `false`, a message will be logged to the console and the msg will not be sent forward to the next component. If evaluated `true`, a message will be passed forward along with all data that passed the condition.

Checkbox:
* If checked, the checkbox adds `Assertion` functionality. Instead of doing nothing, the component will throw an error when the condition is not met.

* `Metadata To Response` Adding passthrough from a previous step to message body as `elasticioMeta` variable, if enabled.

## Additional Notes

*   The JSONata Filter expression can be a valid expression however it can cause an error to be thrown if it is invalid based on the context. For example, 
`$number(hello) > 5` where `hello: "world"`. This JSONata expression is valid but an error will be thrown as `hello` is NaN.
